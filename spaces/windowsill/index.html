            <h2>Overview &amp; What's Possible</h2>
            <p>A windowsill is the most accessible growing space that exists. You already have one. No landlord permission, no balcony, no yard required. If you have a window that gets a few hours of direct sun, you can grow food.</p>
            <p>The realistic output from a windowsill garden is modest but meaningful. Two to four pots of herbs replace $5&ndash;15 per week in grocery store herbs. A tray of microgreens produces a dense handful of nutrition every 10&ndash;14 days. Small containers of lettuce give you a few fresh salad handfuls per week. None of this replaces a full grocery run, but it builds the habit and the skill. Most serious home growers started with a single pot of basil on a windowsill.</p>
            <p>The constraints are real: limited space, limited light, and temperature swings near glass. But within those limits, a windowsill setup is low-cost, low-risk, and immediately rewarding.</p>

            <h2>Best Crops</h2>
            <p>Stick to crops that tolerate limited root space and moderate light levels:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/herbs/">Herbs</a></strong> &mdash; Basil, cilantro, parsley, chives, and mint are the top performers. Basil needs the most light. Mint and parsley tolerate lower light. One herb per 6-inch pot, or group compatible herbs in a longer trough.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/microgreens/">Microgreens</a></strong> &mdash; The single best windowsill crop for nutrition density. Grows in shallow trays, ready in 7&ndash;14 days, and tolerates less light than mature plants. Sunflower, pea shoot, and radish microgreens are the most satisfying to grow.</li>
              <li><strong>Green onions</strong> &mdash; Regrow from store-bought roots placed in a glass of water. Replace the water daily. Harvest tops when they reach 6&ndash;8 inches. They will regrow 3&ndash;4 times before the bulb is spent.</li>
              <li><strong>Small lettuce varieties</strong> &mdash; Loose-leaf lettuce in a 6-inch pot works if you have 4+ hours of sun. Harvest outer leaves only for repeated cuts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Avoid fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers) on a windowsill. They need more light, deeper root space, and better airflow than a sill provides.</p>

            <h2>Equipment Needed</h2>
            <p>Windowsill growing requires minimal gear. Here is what you need to get started:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Small pots with drainage holes</strong> &mdash; 4&ndash;6 inch pots for individual herbs, or a rectangular trough planter that spans your sill width. Terra cotta breathes well but dries faster. Plastic retains moisture longer. Either works.</li>
              <li><strong>Saucers or trays</strong> &mdash; Catch drainage water to protect your windowsill. A baking sheet or plastic tray works fine. Check after watering and empty standing water after 30 minutes.</li>
              <li><strong>Potting mix</strong> &mdash; Use bagged indoor potting mix, not garden soil. Garden soil is too heavy for containers, drains poorly, and may contain pests. A standard all-purpose potting mix is fine for herbs.</li>
              <li><strong>Seeds or starter plants</strong> &mdash; Seeds are cheaper and give more variety. Starter plants give faster results. For a first windowsill garden, buying one basil start and one packet of microgreen seeds is a good combination.</li>
              <li><strong>Misting bottle</strong> &mdash; For watering seeds and microgreens without disturbing the soil surface. A cheap spray bottle from any store works. Mist seeds daily until they germinate, then switch to bottom watering or gentle pouring.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Total startup cost is $10&ndash;30 depending on whether you buy starts or seeds, new pots or repurpose containers you already have.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Setup Guide</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assess your light.</strong> Stand at your window at midday and look at the sun angle. South-facing windows get the most direct light and work for almost every crop. East-facing windows get gentle morning sun &mdash; good for herbs and greens. West-facing windows get hot afternoon sun &mdash; fine for most crops but watch for overheating. North-facing windows rarely get enough direct sun for food crops without supplemental lighting.</li>
              <li><strong>Choose your containers.</strong> Match container size to your sill depth. Measure your sill &mdash; most are 4&ndash;6 inches deep. Choose pots or troughs that fit without overhanging. If your sill is too narrow, a small shelf or plant stand positioned in front of the window extends your growing area.</li>
              <li><strong>Pick your first crops.</strong> Start with one or two plants, not six. Basil is the best single herb to start with: fast-growing, immediately useful in the kitchen, and clearly tells you when it needs water (leaves droop). Add a microgreen tray if you want quick results within the first two weeks.</li>
              <li><strong>Set up your watering routine.</strong> Check soil daily at the same time. Press your finger 1 inch into the soil. If dry, water slowly until it drains from the bottom. If still moist, skip the day. Consistency matters more than precision. Overwatering kills more windowsill plants than underwatering.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Light Assessment</h2>
            <p>Light is the single biggest factor in windowsill growing success. Here is how to evaluate what you have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The shadow test.</strong> On a sunny day at midday, hold your hand 12 inches above the sill. A sharp, well-defined shadow means strong direct light. A faint, fuzzy shadow means indirect light. No shadow means the light is too diffused for most food crops.</li>
              <li><strong>Light meter apps.</strong> Free apps like Lux Light Meter (available for both phone platforms) give you a numerical reading. Aim for at least 10,000 lux for herbs and 5,000 lux for microgreens during peak sun hours. Below 5,000 lux at peak, consider supplemental lighting.</li>
              <li><strong>Track hours, not just intensity.</strong> Even a bright window only counts if the sun hits it for enough consecutive hours. Most herbs need 4&ndash;6 hours of direct sun. Observe your window over the course of a day &mdash; buildings, trees, and overhangs can block sun that you assumed was there.</li>
              <li><strong>Seasonal shift.</strong> Sun angle changes through the year. A window that gets 6 hours of sun in June may get 2 hours in December. In winter, even south-facing windows may need a small clip-on LED grow light to supplement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Maintenance Tips</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Rotate pots weekly.</strong> Plants grow toward the light. Without rotation, you get lopsided growth and weak stems on the room-facing side. Give each pot a quarter turn every week, always in the same direction, so growth stays balanced.</li>
              <li><strong>Clean windows regularly.</strong> Dust and grime on glass blocks more light than you think. A clean window can transmit 10&ndash;15% more light than a dirty one. Clean both sides of the glass monthly during the growing season.</li>
              <li><strong>Watch for drafts in winter.</strong> Single-pane windows radiate cold at night. Basil and other warm-weather herbs suffer below 55&deg;F. In winter, move pots back from the glass at night or place a piece of cardboard between the pots and the window after sunset.</li>
              <li><strong>Harvest frequently.</strong> Regular cutting stimulates new growth and keeps plants compact. Herbs that are never harvested become leggy and eventually bolt. Use what you grow &mdash; that is the point.</li>
              <li><strong>Feed lightly.</strong> Container plants exhaust their soil nutrients faster than in-ground plants. Use a half-strength liquid fertilizer every 2&ndash;4 weeks during active growth. Skip fertilizing in winter if growth has slowed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Problems</h2>
            <dl class="problems-list">
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Insufficient light</dt>
                <dd>The most common windowsill growing problem. Signs include leggy stretched stems, pale leaves, and slow growth. If your window gets fewer than 4 hours of direct sun, add a small LED grow light. Clip-on models cost $15&ndash;25 and make a significant difference. Position the light 6&ndash;12 inches above the plants and run it 10&ndash;14 hours per day.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Overwatering</dt>
                <dd>Small pots in low-light conditions dry slowly. If soil stays wet for more than 2&ndash;3 days, roots begin to rot. Use pots with drainage holes. Let the top inch of soil dry before watering again. Yellow lower leaves and a mushy stem base are signs you have been watering too often.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Temperature swings near glass</dt>
                <dd>Window glass amplifies temperature extremes. Summer afternoon sun through west-facing glass can cook plants. Winter nights near single-pane glass can chill roots. Monitor the temperature at plant level, not room level. Move pots away from glass during extreme conditions.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Root-bound plants in small pots</dt>
                <dd>Roots circling the bottom of the pot mean the plant has outgrown its container. Growth slows, plants wilt quickly after watering, and roots may emerge from drainage holes. Either move to a larger pot or, for herbs, harvest aggressively and start fresh from seed. Most annual herbs do better replaced every 2&ndash;3 months than maintained indefinitely.</dd>
