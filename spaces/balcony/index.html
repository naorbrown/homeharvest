            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A balcony is the first outdoor growing space most apartment dwellers have access to. Even a narrow 4-foot-wide balcony supports a surprising amount of food production when you use the space vertically and choose the right containers. Compared to windowsill growing, a balcony gives you more light, more airflow, and enough room for deeper-rooted crops like tomatoes and peppers.</p>
            <p>The tradeoffs are weather exposure, weight restrictions, and drainage logistics. A balcony garden requires planning around these constraints, but once the setup is right, the growing itself is straightforward. A well-planned balcony with 6+ hours of sun can produce a steady supply of herbs, salad greens, cherry tomatoes, and peppers from spring through fall.</p>

            <h2>Best Crops</h2>
            <p>Balcony growing supports a wider range than windowsill because you have more light and deeper containers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/herbs/">Herbs</a></strong> &mdash; All herbs thrive on balconies. Group them in railing planters or cluster pots together. Basil, cilantro, parsley, rosemary, and thyme are essentials. The increased light and airflow compared to indoors produces more flavorful plants.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/lettuce/">Lettuce and greens</a></strong> &mdash; Loose-leaf lettuce, spinach, arugula, and chard grow well in shallow rectangular containers. They prefer some shade in midsummer, so position them where they get morning sun but afternoon protection from a wall or railing.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/tomatoes/">Tomatoes</a></strong> &mdash; Cherry and determinate (bush) varieties are ideal for containers. One plant per 5-gallon pot minimum. They need full sun &mdash; at least 6 hours of direct light &mdash; and a stake or cage for support. Cherry tomatoes like Tiny Tim and Patio Princess are bred for containers.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/peppers/">Peppers</a></strong> &mdash; Both sweet and hot peppers do well in 3&ndash;5 gallon pots. They love heat, so a south-facing balcony is ideal. Hot peppers in particular are prolific producers in containers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Avoid large crops that need deep soil or extensive root runs: corn, melons, large squash, and full-size indeterminate tomato varieties are poor fits for balcony containers.</p>

            <h2>Equipment</h2>
            <p>Balcony gardens need slightly more gear than windowsill setups because you are dealing with larger volumes of soil, outdoor weather, and drainage concerns:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Containers</strong> &mdash; 3&ndash;5 gallon pots for tomatoes and peppers, smaller pots or troughs for herbs and greens. Fabric grow bags are lightweight alternatives that breathe well. Match container depth to root depth: 6 inches for herbs and lettuce, 12+ inches for tomatoes and peppers.</li>
              <li><strong>Railing planters</strong> &mdash; Designed to hook over standard balcony railings. Great for herbs and small greens. Make sure they are rated for your railing width and have drainage built in.</li>
              <li><strong>Saucers and drip trays</strong> &mdash; Essential. Water draining off your balcony lands on the neighbor below. Use large saucers under every pot and empty them regularly. Some growers place all pots on a single large plastic tray to contain all runoff.</li>
              <li><strong>Potting mix</strong> &mdash; Use a lightweight potting mix designed for containers. Avoid heavy garden soil &mdash; it is unnecessarily heavy for upper floors and drains poorly in pots. Perlite-enriched mixes are lighter and drain better.</li>
              <li><strong>Slow-release fertilizer</strong> &mdash; Granular slow-release fertilizer mixed into the potting mix at planting time feeds for 3&ndash;4 months. Supplement with liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks during peak production for tomatoes and peppers.</li>
              <li><strong>Watering can or drip system</strong> &mdash; A small watering can with a narrow spout gives you control. For larger setups or if you travel, a gravity-fed drip system with a timer saves daily effort and prevents missed waterings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Setup</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assess sun exposure throughout the day.</strong> Spend one full day observing where direct sunlight hits your balcony and for how long. Morning sun comes from the east, afternoon from the south and west. Take note of shadows cast by the building above, adjacent walls, and any overhangs. Your sunniest spots go to tomatoes and peppers. Partially shaded spots go to greens and herbs.</li>
              <li><strong>Check weight limits with building management.</strong> Wet soil is heavy &mdash; a 5-gallon pot of saturated potting mix weighs 30&ndash;40 pounds. A full balcony garden can easily reach 200&ndash;400 pounds. If your building has balcony weight restrictions, calculate your total load before buying supplies. Distribute weight along the edges and near the wall, not in the center of the balcony.</li>
              <li><strong>Plan drainage.</strong> This is the number one source of neighbor conflict in apartment growing. Water must not drip onto the balcony below. Use saucers under every container. Consider self-watering pots that have built-in reservoirs. If your balcony has a drain, position containers so excess water flows toward it.</li>
              <li><strong>Choose containers appropriate for crop root depth.</strong> Herbs and lettuce need 6&ndash;8 inches of soil depth. Tomatoes need 12&ndash;14 inches. Peppers need 10&ndash;12 inches. Deeper pots retain moisture longer and give roots room to grow, which directly translates to better harvests.</li>
              <li><strong>Set up wind protection if on a high floor.</strong> Balconies above the 5th floor can get significant wind. Wind dries soil faster, breaks stems, and stresses plants. Place a row of smaller pots in front of taller plants to create a buffer. A piece of shade cloth or burlap attached to the railing blocks the worst gusts without blocking light.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Weight &amp; Drainage</h2>
            <p>These two issues are critical for upper-floor balconies and often overlooked by new growers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Saturated soil weight.</strong> Dry potting mix weighs about 0.5 pounds per quart. Saturated, it weighs 1&ndash;1.5 pounds per quart. A 5-gallon pot holds about 14 quarts of soil. Dry, that is 7 pounds of soil. After thorough watering, it is 14&ndash;21 pounds plus the weight of the pot and plant. Multiply by your total number of containers to get your full load.</li>
              <li><strong>Use lightweight potting mix.</strong> Mixes with extra perlite and coconut coir are significantly lighter than peat-heavy mixes. Avoid any mix that contains actual soil. For weight-restricted balconies, fabric grow bags are lighter than ceramic or terra cotta.</li>
              <li><strong>Manage runoff.</strong> Water every container slowly until water just begins to drip from drainage holes, then stop. Check saucers 30 minutes after watering and empty any standing water. Standing water attracts mosquitoes, breeds root rot, and may stain or damage the balcony surface.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-watering containers.</strong> These have a built-in reservoir below the soil. Water wicks up from the reservoir as the soil dries. They reduce runoff to nearly zero and are the best option for balconies where drainage onto neighbors is a concern.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Wind &amp; Sun Exposure</h2>
            <p>Balcony microclimates are different from ground-level gardens. Elevation changes everything:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Wind stress increases with height.</strong> Floors 5 and above can get sustained winds that snap stems and dry soil in hours. Tomato cages and sturdy stakes are not optional &mdash; they are structural necessities. Anchor cages to the pot or railing so they do not topple.</li>
              <li><strong>Walls amplify heat.</strong> Concrete and brick walls absorb and radiate heat. A south-facing balcony with a dark wall behind it can be 10&ndash;20&deg;F hotter than ambient temperature. This benefits heat-loving peppers and tomatoes, but can scorch lettuce and herbs. Monitor soil temperature &mdash; if the pot is hot to the touch, the roots are cooking. Move sensitive plants away from the wall or use lighter-colored pots.</li>
              <li><strong>Orientation matters.</strong> South-facing is ideal for most food crops. East-facing works well for greens and herbs. West-facing gets intense afternoon sun that can stress plants in summer. North-facing balconies are challenging &mdash; only shade-tolerant greens like lettuce and spinach will produce.</li>
              <li><strong>Overhangs reduce light.</strong> The balcony above yours may block overhead sun. The effective light your plants receive depends on both orientation and how far the overhang extends. Move containers to the railing edge to capture the widest sun angle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Water daily in summer.</strong> Containers on hot balconies can dry out in a single day. Check soil moisture every morning. In peak summer, large tomato plants in 5-gallon pots may need watering twice daily. If you cannot maintain this schedule, invest in a drip system with a timer.</li>
              <li><strong>Feed regularly.</strong> Container plants depend entirely on the nutrients you provide. Use slow-release granules at planting and supplement with liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks during fruiting. Yellowing lower leaves during active production usually indicate a nitrogen deficiency.</li>
              <li><strong>Prune and train.</strong> Tomatoes need suckering &mdash; remove the small shoots that emerge between the main stem and branches. Peppers benefit from pinching the first few flowers to encourage stronger root growth. Keep herbs pinched to promote bushy growth.</li>
              <li><strong>Inspect for pests weekly.</strong> Aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites are common on balconies. Check the undersides of leaves. A strong spray of water dislodges most soft-bodied pests. Neem oil spray works for persistent infestations. Catch problems early &mdash; pests spread fast in clustered containers.</li>
              <li><strong>Rotate crops between seasons.</strong> Do not plant tomatoes in the same pot two years in a row. Swap potting mix or refresh the top half each season. Soil-borne diseases accumulate in containers just as they do in ground beds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Problems</h2>
            <dl class="problems-list">
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Wind damage</dt>
                <dd>Broken stems and toppled pots are the most visible symptom. Stake all tall plants and anchor pots against the wall or railing. Grouping pots together creates a windbreak effect. On severe wind days, move the most vulnerable plants against the building wall.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Overheating against walls</dt>
                <dd>Dark walls radiate stored heat, cooking soil and roots. Signs include wilting even with moist soil and leaf scorch on the wall-facing side. Move pots 6&ndash;12 inches away from the wall. Use light-colored or fabric pots that dissipate heat better than dark plastic.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Limited drainage options</dt>
                <dd>Apartment leases may restrict water runoff onto lower balconies. Self-watering containers eliminate most runoff. If you use standard pots, water slowly and stop as soon as water appears in the saucer. Keep a towel nearby to soak up overflow.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Pest issues from neighboring plants</dt>
                <dd>Aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies travel between balconies. You cannot control your neighbor's plants, but you can inspect your own weekly and respond quickly. A biodegradable insecticidal soap spray handles most infestations. Isolate any heavily affected plant immediately.</dd>
