            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Indoor growing with artificial light eliminates the two biggest constraints in home food production: available windows and seasonal limitations. A shelving unit with LED grow lights in a spare room, closet, or basement corner produces leafy greens and herbs 365 days a year, regardless of your climate, apartment orientation, or weather.</p>
            <p>The tradeoff is upfront equipment cost and electricity. You are replacing free sunlight with purchased light, which means your per-unit cost is higher than outdoor growing. But for growers in apartments without balconies, in northern climates with long dark winters, or anyone who wants consistent year-round production, an indoor setup is the path to self-reliance.</p>
            <p>An indoor garden is not a replacement for outdoor growing &mdash; it is a complement. The crops that perform best indoors (greens, herbs, microgreens) are the same crops you buy most frequently at the grocery store. Even a small setup displaces $20&ndash;40 per month in produce purchases once established.</p>

            <h2>Best Crops</h2>
            <p>Focus on crops with short stature, fast turnover, and low light demands relative to fruiting plants:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/herbs/">Herbs</a></strong> &mdash; Basil, cilantro, parsley, chives, and mint all thrive under grow lights. Basil is the star performer: fast-growing, productive, and immediately useful. Indoor basil under good lights produces more than outdoor basil in partial shade.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/microgreens/">Microgreens</a></strong> &mdash; The ideal indoor crop. Shallow trays, fast turnaround (7&ndash;14 days), and high nutrition density. Sunflower, pea shoot, radish, and broccoli microgreens are the most popular varieties. You can run 4&ndash;6 trays on a single shelf in continuous rotation.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/lettuce/">Lettuce and greens</a></strong> &mdash; Loose-leaf lettuce, spinach, arugula, and kale all grow well under lights. They tolerate shorter photoperiods than fruiting crops and stay compact. Harvest outer leaves for ongoing production from a single planting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Avoid fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers) for indoor growing unless you are prepared to invest in high-intensity lighting and larger containers. They need significantly more light energy than greens and herbs &mdash; roughly 2&ndash;3 times the intensity &mdash; and take months to produce.</p>

            <h2>Equipment</h2>
            <p>An indoor growing setup has more components than a windowsill or balcony garden. Here is the complete list:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>LED grow light panel or strip</strong> &mdash; The core investment. A full-spectrum white LED panel (not purple/blurple) rated at 100&ndash;200 watts of actual draw covers a 2x2-foot growing area. For a standard shelf, LED strip lights mounted under each shelf provide even coverage. Buy lights rated for actual wattage, not "equivalent" wattage.</li>
              <li><strong>Timer</strong> &mdash; A mechanical or digital outlet timer to automate the light cycle. Set it once and forget it. Inconsistent lighting stresses plants and triggers bolting in lettuce and herbs. A basic mechanical timer costs under $10.</li>
              <li><strong>Shelving unit</strong> &mdash; A standard wire shelving unit (typically 4 shelves, 48 inches wide by 18 inches deep) is the most space-efficient indoor growing setup. Each shelf becomes a growing level. Wire shelves allow light to pass through from above and airflow to circulate.</li>
              <li><strong>Containers</strong> &mdash; Standard nursery pots (4&ndash;6 inch) for individual herbs, shallow 10x20-inch trays for microgreens, and 6&ndash;8 inch pots for lettuce. Use trays or saucers underneath everything to contain water.</li>
              <li><strong>Potting mix</strong> &mdash; Indoor potting mix formulated for containers. Avoid anything with added fertilizer for microgreen trays &mdash; microgreens do not need soil nutrients, just a medium to anchor roots.</li>
              <li><strong>Small fan</strong> &mdash; A small clip-on or desktop fan pointed at the growing area. Gentle airflow strengthens stems, prevents mold, and distributes humidity. Without air movement, indoor plants become leggy and disease-prone.</li>
              <li><strong>Humidity tray</strong> &mdash; A shallow tray filled with pebbles and water, placed near plants. As the water evaporates, it raises local humidity slightly. Indoor environments, especially in winter with heating running, can drop below 30% humidity &mdash; too dry for most greens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Grow Light Guide</h2>
            <p>Lighting is the most important decision in an indoor garden. Understanding the basics prevents expensive mistakes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>LED vs fluorescent.</strong> LEDs are the clear choice for new setups. They produce more light per watt, generate less heat, and last 50,000+ hours versus 10,000 for fluorescents. T5 fluorescent tubes still work but are being phased out. LED strip lights and panels have dropped dramatically in price and are now comparable to or cheaper than fluorescent systems when you factor in bulb replacement and electricity cost.</li>
              <li><strong>PAR and PPFD basics.</strong> PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) is the range of light wavelengths plants use (400&ndash;700nm). PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) measures how much PAR actually reaches your plants, in micromoles per square meter per second. Leafy greens and herbs need 150&ndash;250 PPFD. Fruiting crops need 400&ndash;600+ PPFD. Reputable grow light manufacturers publish PPFD maps for their products &mdash; check these before buying.</li>
              <li><strong>Height and distance from plants.</strong> Light intensity drops rapidly with distance. Doubling the distance between light and plant cuts intensity by roughly 75%. For most LED panels, maintain 12&ndash;18 inches between the light and the plant canopy for greens and herbs. If you see plants stretching toward the light, it is too far away. If leaf tips are bleaching or curling, it is too close.</li>
              <li><strong>Photoperiod by crop type.</strong> Leafy greens and herbs perform well with 14&ndash;16 hours of light per day. Microgreens need 12&ndash;16 hours. Lettuce bolts under very long days (18+ hours), so stay at 14&ndash;16 hours. A dark period is important &mdash; plants perform essential metabolic processes during darkness. Never run lights 24 hours.</li>
              <li><strong>Spectrum.</strong> Full-spectrum white LEDs that look like natural daylight (3500&ndash;5000K color temperature) work well for all vegetable crops. The older purple/pink "blurple" lights use only red and blue wavelengths. They work but produce less pleasant ambient light in your living space and miss green wavelengths that actually do contribute to photosynthesis. For a home setup, white full-spectrum is the better choice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Setup</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Choose a location.</strong> A spare room corner, closet, basement area, or even a wide hallway works. You need access to an electrical outlet, a surface that can handle occasional water spillage, and enough ceiling or shelf height for lights above plants. Temperature should stay between 60&ndash;75&deg;F. Avoid unheated garages or spaces near exterior doors with cold drafts.</li>
              <li><strong>Mount or hang lights at proper height.</strong> For a shelving unit, attach LED strip lights to the underside of each shelf using the adhesive backing or zip ties. For a table or counter setup, hang a panel light from adjustable chains or a light stand so you can raise it as plants grow. Start with lights 14&ndash;16 inches above where the plant canopy will be.</li>
              <li><strong>Set the timer to 14&ndash;16 hours.</strong> Plug your lights into the timer. Set them to turn on early in the morning and off in the evening, roughly matching natural day length. This schedule works for greens, herbs, and microgreens. Consistency matters &mdash; avoid manually overriding the timer.</li>
              <li><strong>Arrange containers on trays.</strong> Place all pots and growing containers on waterproof trays to catch drainage and spills. Organize with taller plants toward the back and shorter trays in front. Leave 1&ndash;2 inches of space between containers for air circulation.</li>
              <li><strong>Set up a fan for gentle airflow.</strong> Position a small fan so it creates a gentle breeze across the plant canopy. The leaves should barely rustle, not whip. Airflow prevents mold, strengthens stems, and helps soil surfaces dry between waterings. Run the fan whenever the lights are on.</li>
              <li><strong>Monitor humidity.</strong> Place an inexpensive digital hygrometer near your plants. Target 40&ndash;60% relative humidity. Below 40%, plants lose water faster than they can absorb it and leaf edges brown. Above 60%, mold risk increases. Use a humidity tray or small humidifier if your indoor air is dry, especially during winter heating season.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Ventilation &amp; Humidity</h2>
            <p>Indoor growing creates a microclimate that needs active management. Plants transpire water through their leaves, and without outdoor airflow, that moisture builds up:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mold risk.</strong> Stagnant, humid air around dense plant growth is the primary trigger for mold and fungal disease. Damping off (seedlings collapsing at the soil line) and powdery mildew (white coating on leaves) are the two most common indoor growing diseases. Both are preventable with adequate airflow.</li>
              <li><strong>Fan placement.</strong> One small fan per growing shelf or area is sufficient. Oscillating fans distribute air more evenly than fixed fans. Point airflow across the canopy, not directly at soil level, to avoid drying out the soil surface too quickly while still moving air around leaves.</li>
              <li><strong>Target humidity range.</strong> 40&ndash;60% is ideal for most food crops. Below 40%, increase humidity with a pebble tray or a small cool-mist humidifier. Above 60%, improve ventilation &mdash; open a door, add a second fan, or reduce the number of plants in the space. A closet grow space is particularly prone to humidity buildup because of the enclosed environment.</li>
              <li><strong>Temperature interaction.</strong> Warm air holds more moisture than cool air. If your grow lights heat the space to 80&deg;F+, humidity may climb faster. Conversely, if the space cools significantly when lights turn off, condensation can form on leaves and soil surfaces. Maintain the most consistent temperature you can.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Year-Round Schedule</h2>
            <p>Unlike outdoor growing, indoor gardens have no seasons. This changes your approach:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stagger plantings for continuous harvest.</strong> Instead of planting everything at once, start new batches every 1&ndash;2 weeks. When one tray of microgreens is ready for harvest, the next tray is a week behind it. When one basil plant starts to decline after 2&ndash;3 months, a younger plant is already producing. This gives you an unbroken supply rather than feast-and-famine cycles.</li>
              <li><strong>Track planting dates.</strong> With no seasonal cues, it is easy to lose track. Label every container with the planting date and variety. A simple log &mdash; even a note on your phone &mdash; helps you know when to start the next succession.</li>
              <li><strong>Refresh soil regularly.</strong> Indoor potting mix does not benefit from the microbial activity that outdoor soil gets. Replace potting mix entirely after 2&ndash;3 growing cycles. For microgreens, use fresh mix for every tray. For long-lived herbs, repot with fresh mix every 3&ndash;4 months.</li>
              <li><strong>Adjust for ambient changes.</strong> Even though your lights stay constant, room temperature and humidity shift with the seasons. Winter heating dries air significantly. Summer cooling may drop humidity less but raises ambient temperature. Check your hygrometer monthly and adjust fan speed or humidifier settings as needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Problems</h2>
            <dl class="problems-list">
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Insufficient light intensity</dt>
                <dd>Even with grow lights, many setups provide less light than plants need. Signs include leggy, stretched growth, pale leaves, and slow development. The most common cause is lights positioned too far from the canopy. Lower your lights to 12&ndash;14 inches above the tallest plants. If growth is still weak, your light may not produce enough PPFD &mdash; check manufacturer specs and consider upgrading to a higher-output panel.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Overheating from lights too close</dt>
                <dd>LEDs produce far less heat than older lighting technologies, but at close range, they can still overheat leaf tissue. Signs include bleached or brown leaf tips and edges, especially on the topmost leaves. Raise the light 2&ndash;3 inches and monitor. If the back of your hand feels warm after 30 seconds held at plant height under the light, the light is too close.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Humidity-related mold</dt>
                <dd>White fuzz on soil surfaces, damping off of seedlings, and powdery mildew on leaves all indicate excess humidity with inadequate airflow. Improve ventilation first: add a fan, open the space to room air, and space containers apart. Remove affected plant material immediately. Allow soil surfaces to dry slightly between waterings. If mold persists, reduce the number of plants in the space to lower overall transpiration.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Fungus gnats</dt>
                <dd>Small flies hovering around soil are fungus gnats. Their larvae live in moist topsoil and feed on organic matter and fine roots. The cause is almost always overwatering. Let the top inch of soil dry completely between waterings. Yellow sticky traps catch adult gnats and break the breeding cycle. A thin layer of coarse sand on the soil surface prevents adults from laying eggs.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Leggy growth</dt>
                <dd>Stems that are long, thin, and weak with wide spacing between leaves indicate the plant is stretching toward inadequate light. This is different from etiolation caused by complete darkness &mdash; in a grow light setup, it means the light is either too far away, not bright enough, or the photoperiod is too short. Lower the light, increase wattage, or extend the light period to 16 hours. Pinch leggy stems to encourage branching once the light issue is corrected.</dd>
