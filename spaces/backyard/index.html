            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A backyard garden, even a small one, is a different category of growing from containers. Direct ground access means deeper root zones, better moisture retention, and the ability to grow crops that containers simply cannot support well &mdash; root vegetables, sprawling squash, corn, large tomato varieties, and perennial fruit bushes.</p>
            <p>The tradeoff is more upfront work. You need to assess and amend your soil, plan layout for sun angles, manage pests that come with open ground, and commit to seasonal maintenance. But the yield per square foot is dramatically higher than any container setup, and the per-crop cost drops quickly after the first season. A single 4x8-foot raised bed produces enough salad greens for a family throughout the growing season.</p>
            <p>Whether you start with one raised bed or convert a full section of lawn, the approach is the same: choose the sunniest spot, build good soil, and start smaller than you think you need.</p>

            <h2>Best Crops</h2>
            <p>With ground access and full sun, you can grow essentially everything. Prioritize crops that give the highest return on space and effort:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/herbs/">Herbs</a></strong> &mdash; Plant a dedicated herb section near your kitchen door for daily harvest access. Perennial herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano go in permanent spots. Annual herbs like basil and cilantro rotate through beds.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/lettuce/">Lettuce and greens</a></strong> &mdash; Fast-growing and space-efficient. Succession plant every 2&ndash;3 weeks for continuous harvests. Greens can tuck into partial shade or fill gaps between slower crops.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/tomatoes/">Tomatoes</a></strong> &mdash; The most rewarding backyard crop for most growers. Full-size indeterminate varieties produce for months. One well-maintained plant yields 10&ndash;20 pounds of fruit per season.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/peppers/">Peppers</a></strong> &mdash; Sweet and hot varieties both produce heavily in warm soil with full sun. Compact plants that fit easily in beds or along edges.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="/homeharvest/guides/microgreens/">Microgreens</a></strong> &mdash; Grow trays outdoors in mild weather for faster growth than indoor setups.</li>
              <li><strong>Root vegetables</strong> &mdash; Carrots, beets, radishes, and potatoes all need ground depth that containers struggle to provide. Radishes mature in 25&ndash;30 days. Carrots need loose, rock-free soil 12 inches deep.</li>
              <li><strong>Squash and cucumbers</strong> &mdash; Sprawling crops that demand space but produce heavily. One zucchini plant is typically enough for a household. Train cucumbers vertically on a trellis to save ground space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Equipment</h2>
            <p>Backyard growing requires real gardening tools. Here is the core set:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Raised bed materials</strong> &mdash; Cedar or untreated lumber for frames. Avoid pressure-treated wood &mdash; the chemicals leach into soil. Cedar naturally resists rot and lasts 8&ndash;10 years. Alternatively, galvanized steel raised bed kits are durable and fast to assemble.</li>
              <li><strong>Garden tools</strong> &mdash; A full-size spade for turning soil, a steel rake for leveling, a hand trowel for planting and weeding, and a wheelbarrow or garden cart for moving soil and compost. Buy once, buy quality. Cheap tools bend and break within a season.</li>
              <li><strong>Hose with adjustable nozzle</strong> &mdash; A standard garden hose with a multi-pattern nozzle covers most watering needs. A gentle shower setting for seedlings, a flat setting for soaking beds. For larger setups, a soaker hose laid along bed rows delivers water directly to the root zone.</li>
              <li><strong>Compost bin</strong> &mdash; A simple three-sided bin made from pallets or wire mesh is sufficient. Compost is the single most valuable soil amendment you can produce for free. Alternatively, a tumbler composter works for smaller spaces.</li>
              <li><strong>Row cover</strong> &mdash; Lightweight fabric draped over beds extends the season by 2&ndash;4 weeks on each end. Also protects against light frost, insect pests, and bird damage. A few lengths of row cover and some wire hoops are inexpensive insurance.</li>
              <li><strong>Stakes and ties</strong> &mdash; Tomato cages, bamboo stakes, and garden twine for supporting tall and vining crops. Budget for more support material than you think you need &mdash; a loaded tomato plant is surprisingly heavy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Setup</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Choose the location with the most sun.</strong> Walk your yard on a sunny day and identify the spot that gets the longest stretch of uninterrupted direct sunlight. Six hours is the minimum for most food crops. Eight or more hours is ideal. Avoid areas shaded by trees, fences, or the house, especially during midday when the sun is highest. South-facing areas with no overhead obstruction are typically best.</li>
              <li><strong>Test your soil pH.</strong> Buy a soil test kit from a garden center or send a sample to your local extension service. Most vegetables prefer a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. If your soil is too acidic, add garden lime. If too alkaline, add sulfur. Knowing your pH before planting prevents months of poor growth from a problem that takes minutes to diagnose.</li>
              <li><strong>Decide between raised beds and in-ground.</strong> Raised beds are better if your native soil is clay-heavy, rocky, compacted, or contaminated. They give you complete control over soil quality and drain well. In-ground plots work if your soil is already decent and you want lower startup cost. Most new growers do best starting with at least one raised bed.</li>
              <li><strong>Build beds if needed.</strong> A 4x8-foot bed is the standard size: reachable from both sides without stepping in, large enough to be productive, small enough to manage. Build two beds and leave 2&ndash;3 feet of path between them for wheelbarrow access.</li>
              <li><strong>Amend soil with compost.</strong> Whether raised bed or in-ground, mix 2&ndash;4 inches of finished compost into the top 8&ndash;10 inches of soil. For new raised beds, fill with a mix of roughly 60% topsoil, 30% compost, and 10% perlite or coarse sand for drainage. This blend provides nutrients, holds moisture, and drains well.</li>
              <li><strong>Plan layout with tall crops on the north side.</strong> Place your tallest crops (tomatoes, corn, trellised beans) on the north edge of beds so they do not shade shorter crops. Medium-height crops (peppers, eggplant) go in the middle. Low crops (lettuce, herbs, radishes) go on the south edge where they receive full sun.</li>
              <li><strong>Install simple irrigation.</strong> Lay soaker hoses or drip tape along each bed row. Connect to a timer. Automated watering for 20&ndash;30 minutes every other day is more effective than sporadic hand watering and saves significant daily time over the course of a season.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Raised Bed Construction</h2>
            <p>If you are building your first raised bed, here is a straightforward approach:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Size.</strong> 4 feet wide by 8 feet long is standard. You can reach the center from either side without stepping into the bed, which prevents soil compaction. Height of 10&ndash;12 inches gives enough depth for all but the deepest root vegetables. If you have mobility issues, build them 24&ndash;30 inches tall.</li>
              <li><strong>Materials.</strong> Cedar is the best wood option: naturally rot-resistant and chemical-free. It lasts 8&ndash;10 years untreated. Douglas fir is cheaper and lasts 4&ndash;6 years. Never use pressure-treated lumber, railroad ties, or painted/stained wood &mdash; all leach chemicals into soil where you are growing food.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction.</strong> Use 2x10 or 2x12 lumber. Cut two 8-foot lengths and two 4-foot lengths. Screw corners together with 3-inch deck screws. Reinforce corners with metal brackets or 4x4 posts for rigidity. Level the bed on the ground &mdash; use a carpenter's level and shim as needed with soil or gravel.</li>
              <li><strong>Bottom protection.</strong> Line the bottom with hardware cloth (half-inch metal mesh) to prevent gophers and moles from tunneling into your beds from below. Staple it to the inside of the frame before filling. If your yard has invasive grasses like bermuda, lay cardboard on the ground under the bed to smother them before they grow up into your soil.</li>
              <li><strong>Filling.</strong> A 4x8x1 foot bed needs approximately 32 cubic feet of soil mix. Fill with a blend of topsoil, compost, and perlite. Water the bed thoroughly after filling and let it settle for a few days before planting. Top off with more mix as it compacts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Composting</h2>
            <p>Composting turns kitchen and yard waste into the best soil amendment available, for free. Every backyard garden benefits from an active compost system:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Kitchen scrap collection.</strong> Keep a small countertop bin or sealed container in your kitchen for vegetable scraps, fruit peels, coffee grounds, eggshells, and tea bags. Empty it into your outdoor compost bin every few days. Avoid meat, dairy, oils, and cooked food &mdash; these attract pests and create odor problems.</li>
              <li><strong>Carbon to nitrogen ratio.</strong> Compost needs a roughly 3:1 ratio of brown (carbon) materials to green (nitrogen) materials by volume. Browns include dry leaves, cardboard, straw, and wood chips. Greens include kitchen scraps, fresh grass clippings, and garden trimmings. Too much green and the pile gets slimy and smells. Too much brown and it decomposes painfully slowly.</li>
              <li><strong>Turning schedule.</strong> Turn the pile with a pitchfork every 1&ndash;2 weeks to introduce oxygen. Active compost heats up to 130&ndash;160&deg;F in the center. Turning moves outer material to the center and speeds decomposition. A turned pile finishes in 2&ndash;3 months. An unturned pile takes 6&ndash;12 months.</li>
              <li><strong>Finished compost signs.</strong> Ready compost is dark brown, crumbly, and smells like forest soil. You should not be able to identify any original ingredients. If you can still see recognizable food scraps or leaves, it needs more time. Sift finished compost through half-inch hardware cloth to remove large chunks before using.</li>
              <li><strong>Worm bin alternative.</strong> If you lack yard space for a traditional pile, a worm bin (vermicompost) works indoors or in a garage. Red wiggler worms process kitchen scraps into rich castings. A properly maintained worm bin has no odor. Start with 1 pound of worms in a ventilated bin with shredded newspaper bedding.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Seed Saving</h2>
            <p>Saving seeds from your best plants reduces cost and gradually adapts your crops to your specific growing conditions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Save from your best plants.</strong> Choose the healthiest, most productive plants as your seed sources. Do not save from the first plant to bolt or the weakest performer. You are selecting for the traits you want to continue.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-pollinating crops are easiest.</strong> Tomatoes, peppers, beans, peas, and lettuce self-pollinate, so saved seeds reliably produce plants similar to the parent. Cross-pollinating crops (squash, corn, brassicas) require isolation distances to prevent unwanted crosses.</li>
              <li><strong>Dry thoroughly.</strong> Spread seeds in a single layer on a paper plate or screen in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight. Allow 1&ndash;2 weeks of drying time. Seeds that are not fully dry will mold in storage. The bend test: a properly dried seed snaps when bent rather than bending.</li>
              <li><strong>Store cool and dark.</strong> Place dried seeds in labeled paper envelopes inside a sealed jar or container. Store in a cool, dark location &mdash; a refrigerator is ideal. Include a small silica gel packet in the storage container to absorb residual moisture.</li>
              <li><strong>Viability.</strong> Most vegetable seeds remain viable for 2&ndash;5 years when stored properly. Onion and parsnip seeds lose viability after 1&ndash;2 years. Tomato and pepper seeds can last 4&ndash;5 years. Test old seeds before planting by sprouting 10 seeds on a wet paper towel &mdash; if fewer than 6 germinate, plant fresh seed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Seasonal Planning</h2>
            <p>A productive backyard garden operates on a seasonal calendar:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Late winter (6&ndash;8 weeks before last frost).</strong> Start tomato, pepper, and eggplant seeds indoors under lights. Order seeds. Clean and repair tools. Turn compost pile.</li>
              <li><strong>Early spring (2&ndash;4 weeks before last frost).</strong> Direct sow cold-hardy crops: peas, spinach, radishes, lettuce, and carrots. Prepare beds by adding compost and raking smooth. Set up irrigation.</li>
              <li><strong>After last frost.</strong> Transplant tomatoes, peppers, and squash outdoors. Direct sow beans, cucumbers, and corn. Mulch around transplants with 2&ndash;3 inches of straw or shredded leaves to retain moisture and suppress weeds.</li>
              <li><strong>Midsummer.</strong> Succession plant lettuce and greens every 2&ndash;3 weeks. Side-dress heavy feeders (tomatoes, squash) with compost. Watch for pest buildup and disease. Start planning fall crops.</li>
              <li><strong>Late summer (8&ndash;10 weeks before first frost).</strong> Plant fall crops: broccoli, kale, cabbage, beets, and carrots. These crops improve in flavor after light frost.</li>
              <li><strong>Fall.</strong> Harvest remaining warm-season crops before frost. Cover sensitive plants with row cover for a few extra weeks. Plant garlic cloves for next year's harvest. Spread leaves and compost on empty beds as winter mulch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Problems</h2>
            <dl class="problems-list">
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Poor soil</dt>
                <dd>Clay, sand, or compacted soil is the most common challenge in new gardens. Clay holds water and suffocates roots. Sand drains too fast and holds no nutrients. The solution for both is the same: add organic matter. Work 3&ndash;4 inches of compost into the top 8 inches of soil annually. Within 2&ndash;3 years, even bad soil becomes productive.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Shade from trees and structures</dt>
                <dd>Mature trees and buildings cast shadows that shift with the seasons. A spot that gets full sun in June may be shaded in March and September when the sun is lower. Prune lower tree branches to raise the canopy. If shade is unavoidable, focus on shade-tolerant crops: lettuce, spinach, kale, and herbs like parsley and cilantro.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Deer and rabbits</dt>
                <dd>The only reliable deer deterrent is a fence 8 feet tall or a double fence system. For rabbits, a 2&ndash;3 foot chicken wire fence buried 6 inches underground stops most incursions. Sprays and repellents work temporarily but require constant reapplication and fail when animals are hungry enough.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Drainage issues</dt>
                <dd>Standing water after rain means poor drainage that will rot roots. Raised beds solve this immediately by elevating the root zone above the water table. For in-ground beds in low areas, create a slight slope or install a French drain alongside the garden. Never plant in a spot where puddles persist more than a few hours after rain.</dd>
              </div>
              <div class="problem-item">
                <dt>Soil compaction</dt>
                <dd>Walking on garden soil compresses air pockets that roots need. Use permanent pathways and never step in the planting area. This is why 4-foot-wide beds work: you can reach the center from either side. If soil is already compacted, work in compost and aerate with a broadfork. Mulch suppresses compaction from rain impact.</dd>
